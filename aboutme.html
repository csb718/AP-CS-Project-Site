    <p>Hello! My name is Conner. I’m a person who is utterly interested in complex concepts and how they relate to a wider context in my life and the world around me. As of now, 2021, I’m a Junior at a high school in California. Out of my six classes, I am taking one programming Robotics course and one AP computer science course. This website is meant to reflect my progress in these classes. Throughout these courses I hope to learn, and believe I am learning, how information is manipulated at a basic level and how to think about these transformations through different programming tools.</p>
