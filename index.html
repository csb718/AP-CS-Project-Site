      <h2>Python CMU Drawings and Shape Exercises</h2>
      <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu">Python CMU</a></p>
      <p>This was an assignment that I completed for my genius hour topic. Throughout this course, I read the informative material and then programmed a picture to fit the sample modelâ€™s design. These shapes include stars, circles, rectangles, and squares, but it also includes text, font, coloring, gradients, dashes, and opacity. As with most things, writing the code was not difficult but understanding where to put the code was somewhat challenging. Especially for this kind of assignment, knowing how to properly layer the shapes, which meant knowing which code to put on top or bottom, was difficult.</p>

      <h2>Snap programming U1L1 Alonzo Game</h2>
      <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=conner%20bush&ProjectName=U1L1-ClickAlonzo%20(8%2F20)">Snap Program</a></p>
      <p>The project shown above is an image of a game programmed in SNAP by BJC. When the Sprite is clicked by the player, it begins to randomly blink around the canvas. After that, everytime the Sprite is clicked, its opacity decreases, it rotates 180 degrees, and blinks away. The player must attempt to click on the Sprite fast enough, so that he can control when it blinks and try to make it disappear completely. While programming this game, it was difficult to make the opacity decrease with a click.</p>

      <h2>Skratch Lab Coordinate Shape Drawer</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/575837687">Skratch Program</a></p>
      <p>This program, although lacking a drawing tool, is meant to draw shapes that correspond to the X and Y coordinates imputed. If the first coordinates imputed are both positive, a square is drawn by using that coordinates as its upper-right corner. The pattern continues for all coordinates given except (0,0). When the origin is imputed, the program asks the user if he wants to draw a square the left or right, positive or negative on the x-axis. Then the program asks if the user wants to draw in the upper or lower quadrants, positive or negative on the y axis. Finally, the program asks what length the user would like the square to be. The program then traces a square with the imputed length into the chosen quadrant. This project uses the IF command extensively, and also transforms many positives and negatives. It was challenging to figure out what transformations had to occur to obtain the desired outcome.</p>
